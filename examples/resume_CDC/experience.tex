    {Graduate Student Researcher (2017-)} % Job title
    {Ph.D. Thesis: Mapping cerebro-cerebellar networks of the human brain during learning}

      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Developed machine learning pipelines to predict cognitive function in the human cerebellum during learning, and tested patients with spinocerebellar ataxia on a series of cognitive tasks to assess cerebellar deficits. My work requires knowledge of both advanced statistics and computer programming (e.g., Python) to analyze high-dimensional and complex neural data.} 
        \item {Led a team of 8 to design and collect 300 experimental hours of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data (during COVID-19 pandemic).}
        \item {Co-wrote an R35 grant that received 5-year funding from the NIH. Managed an institutional review board (IRB) protocol for fMRI experiments.}
        \item {Created a widely adopted mentorship agreement for research assistants to ensure transparency and accountability in mentoring practices. Co-led a journal club for undergraduate research assistants, instructing them on the scientific method and appropriate methods and statistics.}
        \item {Mentored two undergraduate students in designing and writing up honors thesis projects. One student was awarded a \href{https://psychology.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/undergraduate-program/swanaward_application_2019-2020.pdf}{Swan prize [link]} for their work, and presented at a national conference. Prioritized recruitment of students from marginalized demographics.}

    {Western University} % Organization
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Created a novel and highly downloaded map of the human cerebellum using machine learning and advanced statistics.}
      	\item {Led a team of 2 to design and collect a 26-task, 6-session fMRI and behavioral experiment, totaling 250 hours of data collection.}
      	\item {Initiated a collaboration with scientists from Stanford University to use natural language processing to assign cognitive labels ({\href{https://cognitiveatlas.org/}{\textit{cognitiveatlas.org}}}) to the human cerebellum. Developed pipeline for other researchers to replicate my novel approach.}
      	\item {Invested in open-source science. My data, which are publicly available on {\href{https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002105/versions/1.1.0}{\textit{openneuro.org [Link]}}}, have been downloaded >200 times.}
