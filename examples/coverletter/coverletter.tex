\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in cognitive and computational neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley. I have 7+ years of research experience, and leadership expertise in academia and non-profit work. My research consists of hypothesis‐ and data-driven experimentation, and using artificial intelligence and statistics to build models of brain function. I have a strong record of scientific publishing (>300 citations), presenting at research conferences (>10 proceedings), and contributing to open-source science. 
	As a scientist, I believe that I have a responsibility to educate and inform, and I have always enjoyed teaching neuroscience and psychology to students from different backgrounds: undergraduates at UC Berkeley, incarcerated students at San Quentin State Prison, and elementary schoolchildren in the Oakland unified school district. 
	My research interests dovetail strongly with science and health policy, and over the past 5 years, I have worked to promote issues concerning equity, transparency and accountability, and organizational leadership within academia and non-profit organizations. 

\lettersection{Why CDC?}


\lettersection{Why Me?}
I have experience in \textit{managing} and \textit{leading} technical and administrative projects, and collaborating on cross-functional teams. Previous projects have included: 1) implementing departmental policy to strengthen mentor-mentee relationships, 2) spearheading an initiative to pre-register scientific results in a student journal, and 3) developing an open-source programming library to improve the visualization of brain data. 

	My research and non-profit work has involved a high-level of written and oral \textit{communication}, including 1) publishing scientific results in high-impact journals, 2) preparing and delivering presentations at domestic and international conferences, and 3) providing practical consultation to organizational leadership through oral and written presentation. 

	I believe in the power of effective \textit{mentorship}, and I have recruited many students from diverse backgrounds to work with me on scientific projects. My mentorship aims are threefold: 1) educate and inform through regular meetings, 2) support and promote research/academic interests and provide guidance in career pursuits, and 3) supervise and edit written communication in the form of honors thesis projects, poster presentations, and/or scientific articles. 

	My experience has taught me to maintain \textit{productive} and \textit{collaborative} relationships with colleagues. I enjoy setting realistic goals and working efficiently and effectively. I regularly act as a liaison between team leaders in 1) establishing norms, 2) serving as a functional representative for projects, and 3) initiating progress evaluations. 

	Finally, I want to work on projects that matter, whether it's assisting program specialists with the performance of qualitative or quantitative data analyses, or developing protocols or procedures for agency-led activities. I am very excited about a future in the federal government, and I am motivated to apply my quantitative and communication skills to high‐impact projects that serve the American public.
