\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I'm currently finishing my Ph.D. in psychology (cognitive neuroscience) at the University of California, Berkeley. I have 6+ years of hypothesis- and data-driven research experience in the social sciences. In my work, I apply machine learning and statistics to large and complex databases to build models of brain function. I have a strong track record of publishing in high-impact, peer-reviewed scientific journals (>350 citations), presenting at research conferences (>10 proceedings), and making science accessible (>200 downloads of open-access datasets and code). I am passionate about teaching and mentoring, and I have experience working with diverse groups of students, from undergraduates at UC Berkeley, to incarcerated students at San Quentin State Prison. Furthermore, my research interests dovetail strongly with science and technology policy, and over the past 5 years, I have used data-driven solutions to promote issues concerning equity, transparency, and accountability within academia and non-profit organizations. 

\lettersection{Why NCSES?}
As a social scientist, I am keen to use my scientific training, particularly my expertise in data science and statistics, to work on innovative projects that ensure U.S. competitiveness in science, engineering, and technology. An analytic position perfectly marries my experience in research and science communication with my passion for data wrangling and mathematical reasoning. In addition, the PMF program at NCSES offers a unique opportunity for professional development training, and I am very eager to hone my leadership skills through meaningful work assignments. Most importantly, I am excited at the prospect of working in a highly interdisciplinary position, alongside colleagues who, as well as being innovative thinkers, are creative, thoughtful, and driven. 

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I have gained a lot of technical expertise during my Ph.D. with a particular focus on data science techniques and advanced statistics. However, as every scientist knows, non-technical skills are integral to successful research, from developing efficient communication strategies for managing cross-functional projects, to establishing norms and guidelines for collaborative decision-making. I believe that I can use these skills to coordinate and develop data projects with national impact, overseeing the full life-cycle from concept to final reports. My previous work has  required a high level of adaptability and critical thinking, from grant/paper writing and editorial duties, to high-level project planning and coordination of goals across interdisciplinary teams. I am excited about my future in public service, and I am especially keen to apply the skills I acquired during my PhD to high impact projects that advance research and development in the U.S.
