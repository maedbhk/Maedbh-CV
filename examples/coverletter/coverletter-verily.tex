\lettersection{About Me}
I'm currently finishing my Ph.D. in cognitive and computational neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley. I have 6+ years of scientific research experience, and leadership expertise in academia and non-profit work. My research consists of hypothesis- and data-driven experimentation. In my work, I apply machine learning and statistics to complex neural databases to build models of brain function in an effort to understand learning and memory. I have a strong track record of publishing in high-impact, peer-reviewed scientific journals (>370 citations), presenting at research conferences (>10 proceedings), and making science accessible (>200 downloads of open-access datasets and code). I also enjoy teaching and mentoring diverse groups of students, from undergraduates at UC Berkeley to incarcerated students at San Quentin State Prison. I believe in leading with equity, which can be achieved through effective mentorship, and during my Ph.D. I mentored many students from diverse backgrounds on a wide array of research projects. Furthermore, my research interests dovetail strongly with science and technology policy, and over the past 5 years, I have used data-driven solutions to promote issues concerning equity, transparency, and accountability within academia and non-profit organizations. 

\lettersection{Why Verily?}
I was motivated to apply for this fellowship at Verily for a few reasons. First, as a neuroscientist, I am keen to use my scientific and data-driven expertise to work on innovative projects that exist at the intersection of health sciences, technology, and data science. Projects such as Onduo and OneFifteen have enormous potential to transform how individuals are supported in accessing healthcare, and I would like to be involved in the process of translating basic science research into real-world outcomes. Second, the transition from academia to industry can be daunting, but what appeals to me about this fellowship is 1) the opportunity to sample diverse projects as part of cross-functional teams, and 2) contribute to innovation at Verily by applying the skills I have acquired over the past few years as a scientist, educator, and mentor. Most importantly, I am excited at the prospect of working alongside colleagues who, as well as being creative thinkers, are thoughtful and driven. 

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I have gained a lot of technical expertise during my STEM Ph.D., with a particular focus on data science techniques and advanced statistics. However, as every scientist knows, non-technical skills are integral to successful research, from developing efficient communication strategies for managing cross-functional projects, to establishing norms and guidelines for collaborative decision-making. I believe that I have the skills necessary to work in many different capacities at Verily, from coordinating and developing projects with widespread impact, to overseeing the full life-cycle of a project from concept to final reports. While I have expertise conducting basic science research, I am now keen to work on projects that translate scientific knowledge into clinical and public health outcomes. Some of my previous work has involved grant writing, editorial duties, conference organization, high-level project planning, patient testing, setting up computational clusters, leading a team during the COVID-19 pandemic to collect 300+ hours of neuroimaging data, and using data-driven solutions to advise university leadership on program evaluations. Some of the most rewarding research projects I have undertaken during my Ph.D. have been patient projects in which I tested individuals with spinocerebellar ataxia on a series of tasks to assess cognitive deficits. This work drove home the importance of doing basic science research within the broader context of translational clinical outcomes.
