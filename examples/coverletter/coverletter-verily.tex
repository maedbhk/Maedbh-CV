\lettersection{About Me}
I'm currently finishing my Ph.D. in cognitive and computational neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley. I have 6+ years of research experience, and leadership expertise in academia and non-profit work. My research consists of hypothesis- and data-driven experimentation, and I apply machine learning and statistics to large and complex databases to build models of brain function. I have a strong track record of publishing in high-impact, peer-reviewed scientific journals (>350 citations), presenting at research conferences (>10 proceedings), and making science accessible (>200 downloads of open-access datasets and code). I also enjoy teaching and mentoring diverse groups of students, from undergraduates at UC Berkeley to incarcerated students at San Quentin State Prison. Furthermore, my research interests dovetail strongly with science and technology policy, and over the past 5 years, I have used data-driven solutions to promote issues concerning equity, transparency, and accountability within academia and non-profit organizations. 

\lettersection{Why Verily?}
As a neuroscientist, I am motivated to work at the NIH as a health specialist and use my scientific and data-driven expertise to support and strengthen research programs in U.S. institutions, and work on projects that lead the way in creative and collaborative discoveries. I am excited at the prospect of using my experience as a scientist, educator, and mentor to work at the foundation of medical and scientific innovation, and I am particularly interested in a scientific program analyst role. Furthermore, the at-large PMF program at the NIH offers a unique opportunity for professional development training, and I am very eager to hone and develop my leadership skills and expertise through meaningful work assignments. Most importantly, I am excited at the prospect of working alongside colleagues who, as well as being innovative thinkers, are creative, thoughtful, and driven. 

* The CDC is highly effective at communicating complex scientific findings to non-expert audiences, and in making sound decisions driven by ethical consideration and critical analysis.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I have gained a lot of technical expertise during my STEM Ph.D., with a particular focus on data science techniques and advanced statistics. However, as every scientist knows, non-technical skills are integral to successful research, from developing efficient communication strategies for managing cross-functional projects, to establishing norms and guidelines for collaborative decision-making. I believe that I have the skills necessary to work as a health specialist at the NIH. For example, I have the ability to develop qualitative and quantitative analytic methods to evaluate program efficiency, and indeed I have previously used my data science training to recommend data-driven solutions to university leadership, resulting in increased stipends for psychology graduate students. Further, I have co-written two NIH grants (R35 was funded, R01 was not) with my PhD supervisor, therefore, I have the knowledge required to review grant applications, and identify reviewers with the appropriate expertise. I have managed large-scale neuroimaging projects and I therefore can take on many roles that involve planning, program development, and analysis. Finally, it is because of funding from the NIH that I have been able to conduct high-quality scientific research during my Ph.D. For this reason, I would relish the opportunity to apply what I have learned, namely quantitative and communication skills, to high-impact projects that push the boundaries of scientific knowledge.

* My research and non-profit work has involved a high level of written and oral communication, including 1) publishing scientific results in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals, 2) preparing and delivering presentations at domestic and international conferences, 3) providing practical consultation to university leadership to inform policy changes, and 4) delivering educational lectures to undergraduate students at UC Berkeley and San Quentin State Prison. 

* I believe in the power of effective mentorship, and I have recruited many students from diverse backgrounds to work with me on scientific projects. My academic mentorship aims have been threefold: 1) educate and empower through positive reinforcement and critical feedback, 2) support and promote research/academic interests and provide guidance in career pursuits, and 3) supervise and edit written communication in the form of honors thesis projects, poster presentations, and/or scientific articles.

* leading with equity

* I believe that I can use these skills to coordinate and develop data projects with national impact, overseeing the full life-cycle from concept to final reports.

* My experience has taught me to maintain productive and collaborative relationships with colleagues from all over the world. I regularly act as a liaison between team leaders in 1) establishing norms and guidelines for collaborative decision making, 2) serving as a functional representative on team projects, and 3) initiating progress evaluations to ensure adherence to project timelines

* My previous work has been fast-paced and has required a high level of adaptability and critical thinking, from grant writing and editorial duties, to high-level project planning and coordination of goals across interdisciplinary teams.

*  I believe that I have the skills necessary to work in many different capacities at Verily, and while I have expertise in conducting basic science research, I am now keen to work on projects that translate scientific knowledge into clinical and public health outcomes. Some of my previous work has involved grant writing, editorial duties, conference organization, high-level project planning, patient testing, setting up computational clusters, leading a team of 5 during COVID-19 pandemic to collect 300+ hours of neuroimaging data, and using data-driven solutions to advise university leadership on program evaluations. 

* integrating unique perspective and skill sets into high growth environment: planning, designing, implementing evidence generation programs, assessing existing projects, developing thought leadership publications. 

* direct experience in health services research, statistics, quality improvement, computer science, data science. 
* track record of academic and scientific writing, and preparing and submitting manuscripts 

* study design, statistical, and data science methodologies. 

* Finally, I want to work on projects that matter both in terms of scale of impact, and importance to the wider community. I have far-reaching expertise that could be used to 1) ...
