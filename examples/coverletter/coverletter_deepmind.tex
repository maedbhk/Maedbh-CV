\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
As a PhD candidate in cognitive and computational neuroscience, my research interests dovetail predictive modeling of brain function, and neuroimaging as a tool to diagnose neurodegenerative disorders. I design large-scale neuroimaging studies and use machine learning to understand how the human cerebellum contributes to cognitive function. In doing machine learning research, I have become concerned with the ethical implications accompanying technological advances. I believe that as we design for the future, we have a great responsibility to create artificial intelligence algorithms that are free from historical and implicit biases.

\lettersection{Why Deepmind?} 

I am drawn to Deepmind for many reasons: the innovative design, integrity and rigor in advancing basic science, and the development of real world solutions for real world problems. I believe that Deepmind cares deeply about equity, and recognizes that they have a responsibility to do well and to do good. 

Deepmind pushes past the edge of knowledge by continuously breaking boundaries, and setting its sights on challenges that seem impossible until they become a reality (e.g., AlphaFold, NowCasting, AlphaStar). The prospect of working alongside people who think creatively and critically, is simultaneously thrilling and humbling.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
 
All of my work thus far: designing a comprehensive functional map of the human cerebellum, developing tools to assess functional organization within individuals, and building predictive models of cortico-cerebellar connectivity, is done with the knowledge that these tools and techniques will someday be used to diagnose cerebellar abnormalities implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, autism, and dyslexia). I am keen to work in an environment where those future-oriented solutions are already being designed. 

Finally, we are in a rapidly evolving era of technological transformation, with more data than ever before, and so we must tread carefully. I understand technology well enough to know that advances in artificial intelligence do not confer meaningful social progress. I want to work on projects that have the potential to advance knowledge as well as empower ordinary and historically marginalized people. Regardless of the work, I will lead with equity, and uphold principles of integrity, accountability, and transparency.
