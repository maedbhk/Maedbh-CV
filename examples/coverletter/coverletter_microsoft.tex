\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I'm currently a PhD candidate in cognitive neuroscience at UC Berkeley. I design large-scale neuroimaging studies and use machine learning to map the connectivity between the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum ("little brain"). The holy grail of cognitive neuroscience is to understand what the cerebellum is doing in cognition. My research attempts to answer this question, and the more I learn, the more I am fascinated by this mysterious yet widely misunderstood brain structure.

\lettersection{Why Microsoft?}
Microsoft pushes past the edge of knowledge by continuously breaking boundaries, and setting its sights on challenges that seem impossible until they become a reality. It is clear that Microsoft values the diverse perspectives that each person brings and fosters a spirit of collaboration that sets them apart. The prospect of working in an environment where employees are required to think creatively and critically is simultaneously thrilling and humbling.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
My experience in conducting scientific research has ignited a passion for discovery that extends beyond the confines of academia. My entire academic career has been spent using machine learning to understand the cerebellum, the "underdog" of the brain, and through my work, I have managed to convince many people of its importance. I focus on difficult questions, not because they are popular, but because they are important. 

I want to design solutions that empower ordinary people, whether it's advancing VS code or connecting people through Microsoft teams. The capacity that machine learning has to advance human well-being and social connection is enormous, but I also know that there is great power in the questions we ask, the challenges we set, and our motivation to solve them.
