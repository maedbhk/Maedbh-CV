    {Graduate Student Researcher (2017-)} % Job title
    {Ph.D. Thesis: Mapping cerebro-cerebellar networks of the human brain during learning}
    {\href{https://github.com/maedbhk/cerebellum_learning_connect}{\textbf{Github [Link]}}}
    {University of California, Berkeley} % Organization

      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Deployed \textit{machine learning} pipelines to predict cognitive function across learning in the \textit{human cerebellum}. My work requires knowledge of advanced statistics and expertise in Python programming to analyze high-dimensional and complex neural data.} 
        \item {\textit{Led a team of 8} to design and collect \textit{300 experimental hours} of functional magnetic resonance imaging \textit{(fMRI)} and \textit{eye-tracking} data.}
        \item {Co-wrote an \textit{R35 grant} that received 5-year funding from the \textit{NIH} and \textit{managed} an \textit{IRB protocol} for neuroimaging experiments.}
        \item {Created a widely adopted \textit{mentorship agreement} for research assistants to ensure \textit{transparency and accountability} in mentoring practices. Co-led a \textit{journal club} for undergraduate research assistants, \textit{instructing} them on the \textit{scientific method} and appropriate methods and statistics.}
        \item {\textit{Mentored two undergraduate students} in designing and writing up honors thesis projects. One student was awarded a \textit{Swann prize} for their work, and presented at a national conference. Prioritized \textit{recruitment} of students from marginalized demographics.}

    {Graduate Student Researcher (2015-2017)} % Job title
    {M.Sc. Thesis: Understanding the functional organization of the human cerebellum}
    {\href{http://ivrylab.berkeley.edu/uploads/4/1/1/5/41152143/functional_boundaries_in_the_human_cerebellum.pdf}{\textbf{Paper [Link]}}}
    {Western University} % Organization
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {My thesis used \textit{machine learning} and \textit{advanced statistics} to produce a novel and highly downloaded map of the human cerebellum.}
      	\item {\textit{Led a team of 2} to design and collect a 26-task, 6-session \textit{fMRI} and behavioral experiment, totaling 250 hours of data collection.}
      	\item {\textit{Initiated} a \textit{collaboration} with scientists from Stanford University to use \textit{natural language processing and regularized regression} to assign cognitive labels ( {\href{https://cognitiveatlas.org/}{\textit{cognitiveatlas.org}}}) to the human cerebellum. Developed pipeline for other researchers to replicate my novel approach.}
      	\item {Invested in \textit{open-source science}. My data, which are publicly available on {\href{https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002105/versions/1.1.0}{\textit{openneuro.org [Link]}}}, have been downloaded \textit{>200} times.}
