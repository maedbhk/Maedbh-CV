    {2017-2022} % Organization
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Designed and tested a large-scale fMRI study (5 sessions; 300 experimental hours) to investigate how the cerebellum learns, and developed machine learning pipelines to characterize cortico-cerebellar connectivity. Tested patients with cerebellar ataxia on cognitive tasks to assess impairment. Analyzed post-mortem brain data to create a transcriptomic map of the cerebellum. Co-developed SUITPy, a Python library to visualize brain data.}
        \item {Recorded >15 hours of varsity athletes, and implemented markerless labeling of videos to understand human performance in predicting action \href{https://github.com/maedbhk/action_prediction}{\textit{[link]}}.}
        \item {Awarded certificate in applied data science by taking graduate classes in advanced statistics and computer science to analyze high-dimensional data.} 
        \item {Co-wrote an R35 grant that received 5-year funding from the NIH. Managed an institutional review board (IRB) protocol for fMRI experiments.}
        \item {Created a widely adopted mentorship agreement for research assistants to ensure transparency and accountability in mentoring practices \href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m7PI3lnOZpKdLxWAtxvjcXeQ3xG7I8r0/view?usp=sharing}{\textit{[link]}}.}

    {Western University} % Organization
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Created a novel and highly downloaded map {\href{http://www.diedrichsenlab.org/imaging/mdtb.htm}{\textit{[link]}}} of the human cerebellum using machine learning and advanced statistics.}
      	\item {Led a team of 2 to design and collect a 26-task, 6-session fMRI and behavioral experiment, totaling 250 hours of data collection {\href{http://www.diedrichsenlab.org/imaging/AtlasViewer/viewer.html}{\textit{[link]}}}.}
      	\item {Initiated a collaboration with scientists from Stanford University to use natural language processing to assign cognitive labels to the human cerebellum {\href{https://cognitiveatlas.org/}{\textit{[link]}}}. Developed programming pipeline for other researchers to replicate my novel approach, and wrote supporting documentation.}
      	\item {Invested in open-source science. My data, which are publicly available, have been downloaded >200 times {\href{https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002105/versions/1.1.0}{\textit{[link]}}}.}
