Incoming ICoN fellow at MIT with leadership experience in academia and non-profit work. 6+ years experience conducting hypothesis- and data-driven research, and using machine learning and statistics to build models of brain function. Strong record of publishing in scientific journals (>10 articles, >400 citations), presenting at research conferences (>10 proceedings), and making science accessible (2 open-source datasets and 1 Python module). Passionate about using my experience as an educator and academic mentor to communicate complex ideas to non-expert audiences. Strongly believe in leading with equity, and using data-driven solutions to formulate and recommend policy. Motivated to apply my quantitative and communication expertise to high-impact projects that promote egalitarian health-care solutions.
