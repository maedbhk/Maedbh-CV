      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Developed machine learning pipelines to predict cognitive function in the human cerebellum during learning, tested patients with spinocerebellar ataxia on a series of cognitive tasks to assess cerebellar deficits, analyzed post-mortem  human brain data to create a transcriptomic map of the human cerebellum, and led a team of 5 to collect 300 experimental hours of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data (during COVID-19 pandemic).}
        \item {Co-wrote an R35 grant that received 5-year funding from the NIH. Managed an institutional review board (IRB) protocol for fMRI experiments.}
        \item {Created a widely adopted mentorship agreement for research assistants to ensure transparency and accountability in mentoring practices. Co-led a journal club for undergraduate research assistants, instructing them on the scientific method, data analysis, and statistics.}

      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        %\item {My thesis used \textit{machine learning} to map cognitive sub-domains of the human cerebellum.}
      	\item {Created a novel map of the human cerebellum by applying matrix factorization to high-dimensional neural data {\href{http://www.diedrichsenlab.org/imaging/mdtb.htm}{[\textit{link}}]}.}
      	\item {Initiated a collaboration with scientists from Stanford University to use natural language processing and regularized regression to assign cognitive labels {\href{https://cognitiveatlas.org/}{\textit{[link]}}} to the human cerebellum. Invested in open-source science, the data are publicly available and have been downloaded >200 times {\href{https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002105/versions/1.1.0}{[\textit{link}}]}.}
